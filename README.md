# Unique-Vertex-Finder-1
This program reads a list of vertices and uses an unordered_set to identify unique vertices. As it processes each vertex, it checks whether the vertex has already been stored in the set; if it is found, the program prints that it is a duplicate, and if not, it adds the vertex to the set and prints that it is new.
